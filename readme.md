==Ceilidh v0.1==

This repository has been pre-configured with a .gitignore and .gitattributes file specific to Unity projects using git-lfs. 

This project was created for Unity [2021.3.4f1](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive)

The project has been created with a barebones folder structure.  The settings have been optimized for best 3D quality without adding any additional packages to the project.
For 2D projects, go to Edit -> Project Settings -> Editor and set the "Default Behaviour Mode" to 2D.  Do this at the start so that imported assets are optimized automatically.

Please make sure you place all of your Terrain in a folder called "Terrain" or "Terrains". Failing to do so will result in corupted projects.

For full details on this project's settings, please read the Changelog.md
